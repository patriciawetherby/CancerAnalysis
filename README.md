# CancerAnalysis
WGU CS Capstone - Cancer Analysis Project

Description: This application allows users to enter in a County and State name and the program uses a Linear Regression formula to calculate the predicted death rate
cancer in that county based on cancer death count, cancer incident count, cancer incidence rate, and median income.

Directions:

1. Under COUNTY DATA, please input the desired county. Please use the format [County Name, State]. Input is case sensitive and requires the exact formatting. Incorrect
formatting will result in a prompt to re-enter a valid county. Nevada counties are not present in the dataset. 
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook application. Under Program Results the software should output the Chosen County, Predicted Death Rate, and Prediction
Accuracy % of the result.
